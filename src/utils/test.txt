Arguments:

void(*funcd)(S, S&, S&):
This is a pointer to a function that calculates the function value and its derivative at a given point. The function signature should be void funcd(S x, S& f, S& df), where:
x is the point at which the function and its derivative are evaluated.
f is an output parameter that will store the function value at x.
df is an output parameter that will store the derivative of the function at x.
const S x1:
The lower bound of the interval where the root is bracketed.
const S x2:
The upper bound of the interval where the root is bracketed.
const S xacc:
The desired accuracy for the root. The algorithm will stop iterating when the change in the root estimate is smaller than this value.
Explanation

double x1, x2, xacc
